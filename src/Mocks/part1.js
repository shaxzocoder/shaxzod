        question: "What was the first film that you watched?",
        answer:"The first film that I vividly remember watching is 'The Lion King.' I was around six years old when my dad bought a cartoon CD and played on tv. The animated characters, the captivating storyline, and the powerful soundtrack left a lasting impression on me. I can still recall the excitement and awe I felt during that experience. The movie not only entertained me but also introduced me to the magic of cinema. Since then, I've developed a deep appreciation for films and storytelling in general."

        question: "Do you like to watch movies alone or with your friends? Do you like to go to the cinema with your friends?",
        answer:"I generally prefer watching movies with friends rather than alone. The shared experience of enjoying a film with friends adds a social dimension to the activity, making it more enjoyable and memorable. It provides an opportunity to discuss the movie afterward, share opinions, and even discover new films together. Additionally, laughter or reactions during key moments in the movie become more contagious when shared with friends, creating a more immersive and entertaining experience. While watching alone has its merits, such as the ability to focus entirely on the film, the social aspect of watching movies with friends enhances the overall enjoyment for me."
